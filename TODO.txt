Future features:
    Patching tool
    Readme
    Sample script
    State indication (field 1C) of drawable objects? May help with AI
    Something for damage boost direction? Got to understand exactly how that works first
Enhancements:
    Display all types of errors in the game window.  Maybe use GDI drawing on the window's DC in IncFrame since that should be between a Present and a Sleep?
    Support non-default key mappings
    Jump preview?
Better uninitialised data hooking: afaics, every object is created through obj_add or obj_add_instantiate, so mod those to set obj->create to an imported function which does its own stuff then obj->create = obj->create2; / *always set to create, purpose unknown */ return obj->create();
Bugs:
    Why does resetting in game after remote shopping desync shops by one frame if you then TAS reset?
