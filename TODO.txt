Future features:
    Patching tool
    Readme
    Sample script
    State indication (field 1C) of drawable objects? May help with AI
    Something for damage boost direction? Got to understand exactly how that works first
Enhancements:
    Display all types of errors in the game window.  Maybe use GDI drawing on the window's DC in IncFrame since that should be between a Present and a Sleep?
    Support non-default key mappings
