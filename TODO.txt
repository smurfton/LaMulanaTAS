Future features:
	Patching tool
	Collision map visualisation
	Dynamic platform visualisation
	HP and damage visualisation on hitboxes and hurtboxes
Enhancements:
	Internal bitmap font (required for all new visualisation)
	Catch D3D errors
	Display all types of errors in the game window.  Maybe use GDI drawing on the window's DC in IncFrame since that should be between a Present and a Sleep?
	Add a way to play at normal speed without vsync? The game's frame limiter isn't very good so vsync does need to remain the default and have a hotkey
