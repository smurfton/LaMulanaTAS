Future features:
    Patching tool
    Readme
    Sample script
    State indication (field 1C) of drawable objects? May help with AI
    Something for damage boost direction? Got to understand exactly how that works first
Enhancements:
    Display all types of errors in the game window.  Maybe use GDI drawing on the window's DC in IncFrame since that should be between a Present and a Sleep?
    Change overlay hooking to be at 4a30f1 after all postprocessing but before the surface is blitted to the window
    Do my own loop including blitting to allow interactivity while the game is paused for frame advancing
    Support non-default key mappings
    Jump preview?
Better uninitialised data hooking: afaics, every object is created through obj_add or obj_add_instantiate, so mod those to set obj->create to an imported function which does its own stuff then obj->create = obj->create2; / *always set to create, purpose unknown */ return obj->create();
    Change input hooking code
        Replace the read_keys kb_enabled check with a call to a tas dll function which overrides kb_enabled only if there is scripted keyboard input that frame
        Replace curinputdev=4 in winproc for key events with a new global which TasIncFrame will copy to curinputdev if it's 4 and there is no scripted input that frame and zero every frame.  Set curdevinputdev=4 if there's scripted keyboard input
Bugs:
    Why does resetting in game after remote shopping desync shops by one frame if you then TAS reset?
