# This is a comment
# Don't actually use this as the start of a full game script, it's simplified

# Every script should start by seeding the prng
# This is equivalent to starting the game at a specific wall clock time
rng=14
# You can also simulate rng steps with rng+x, rng-x or rng=seed+x, rng=seed-x
# A final script must only set rng once at the start of the script obviously

# All actions and inputs are for specific frame numbers
@1 # This is an absolute frame reference

# Keyboard inputs:
# up down left right (hardcoded)
# jump main sub item
# +m -m +s -s +menu -menu (main weapon, subweapon and menu switching)
# pause
# msx (cannot be rebound in game but is technically configurable, default ESC)
# ok cancel
# ok2/space ok3/return cancel2/bksp cancel3/esc (hardcoded)
# f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 f8 f9 (hardcoded)

# The game doesn't consider them to be "any button" for the intro sequence
